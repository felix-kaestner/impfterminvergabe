# impfterminvergabe

A simple **proof of concept** automation for getting a vaccination appointment against COVID-19 in Saxony, Germany.

## Idea

This project provides a simple automation build on top of [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) which launches a new
Chrome window and submits the form for getting a vaccination appointment. In case you get a suggestion for an available
appointment the automation stops and leaves you with an open Chrome window, in which case you can decide to accept or
decline and complete the procedure manually.

## Quick Start

1. Generate a user account at [https://sachsen.impfterminvergabe.de/](https://sachsen.impfterminvergabe.de/).

    Make sure to save the `username` ("Vorgangskennung") and `password` of your account. You might also want to generate a second user, if you want to get an appointment together with someone other.


2. Make sure you have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/chrome/) (or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)) installed on your machine. Get the exact version number of Chrome installed on your machine. Simple click the three dots in the upper right corner of Chrome and select `Help > About`. You should find a version number like `Version 90.0.4430.212 (Offizieller Build) (64-Bit)`.


3. Download the appropriate [Chrome Webdriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for your Chrome version and operating system. Afterwards, extract the `chromedriver` (or `chromedriver.exe`) file from the zip archive.


4. Create a virtual environment using [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) and install the [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) package.

    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source ./env/bin/activate # or .\env\Scripts\activate on Windows
    $ pip install selenium beepy
    ```
   Otherwise, just use the integration of an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/) to get you started.


5. Run the script.

    ```bash
    $ python3 main.py --username="hallo" --password="welt" --impfzentrum="Dresden"
    $ python3 main.py --username="hallo" --password="welt" --impfzentrum "Dresden" "Belgern"
    ```
## Windows Version

Try the main.exe on Windows, though I cannot properly test it, it should work.
